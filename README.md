# KonfHubAssignment

Google Colab was used to implement the tasks. 

## Task 1

The results are stored in conference_details.csv file.

## Task 2

The result is visible in the python file. 

## Task 3
To find the semantic duplicates, I've used 'searchKeyword' values available from the json data. If the similarity of 'searchKeyword' values of 2 conferences is more than 0.85 then the conferences are said to be semantic duplicates.
